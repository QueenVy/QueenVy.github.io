<h5>Personal Business<h5>
  <p>Drawing and creating kandi crafts are one of my biggest hobbies and interests. I love making fanart for the media I consume as well as kandi to compliment my bold personality.</p>
  <p>I run my shop on my<a href="https://www.instagram.com/choppy_stix/">art Instagram</a>and have sold to my school peers to cosplayers in Florida. My<a href="https://choppystix.carrd.co/">carrd</a>has more info on my shop!</p>

  <p>While some may say gaming is a waste of time, Ensemble Stars is a game that I believe is worth my time and effort. Have you ever had a game that makes you grind for a png of a fictional idol? Have you ever pulled on a gacha over 100 times for your best boy and him to not come home and force you to shed tears because you are a free to play player? Do you ever stay up at night before a calculus test thinking about [insert character]'s lore and cry about it? No? Well, for me, Emsemble Stars made me say yes to every question listed.</p>
  <p>Ensemble Stars, or Enstars for short, is an idol gacha rhythm game where I tap tap my way towards sucess. Playing on both the Japanese and English server, I would say I am pretty decent, full comboing 95%+ expert beatmaps, including Neo Sanctuary, Distorted Heart, Exceed, Last Lament, and more. While to a non-enstarries, you may not know what that means, just know it is quite impressive. Some other facts about my Enstars journey: my favorite character is Hiyori Tomoe and will always be Hiyori. My close second fav is Tetora becuase I like that his hair looks like Shadow the Hedgehog. I also happen to own a Yuzuru Fushimi nui (plushie), which I take very good care of (pictured below).</p>
  <p>As a whole, through Ensemble Stars' unique lore, it has taught me lessons about self-confidence, loving myself, how to not commit a war crime, and friendship. I would 10/10 reccomend this game to any person who loves music, anime, and pretty people.</p>

<h5>Anime & Ita Bags<h5>
  <p>Along with Enstars, I have been an avid anime watcher since my middle school days. From Digimon and Naruto, to now having brain rots over Bungou Stray Dogs, and Revolutionary Girl Utena, anime has been a huge interest for me. In the past, I have even attended Anime Expo, a large anime convention in LA. I went in 2017 and 2018, hopefully planning to go back with my anime friend from New York, Yutt. Some of my favorite animes include Bungou Stray Dogs, Sound Euphonium, Death Note, and Revolutionary Girl Utena.</p>
  <p>To express my enjoyment for anime, I have multiple ita bags, which are bags with a clear front for fans to display merch. I have bags for Maya from Bang! Dream, Riddle from Twisted Wonderland, and an everyday ita bag with a couple of Enstars merch.</p>
<br>
  <p>My love for anime and pop culture has allowed me to create kandi crafts for my shop and personal style.</p>

<h5>Traveling<h5>
  <p>My family really enjoys to travel around the world to explore different cultures. Some of my favorite trips include Japan, Vietnam, and Canc√∫n. In the future, I hope to travel back to Vietnam to see my parent's hometown and eat food. I also hope to travel to Japan again with my friends.</p>
