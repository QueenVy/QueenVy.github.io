    <h5>Background<h5>
      <p>I'm Deanna and I am currently a senior at Monrovia High School! I am Vietnamese and love eating, drawing, and playing Ensemble Stars. I also play the flute in my school's marching band and now head drum major. Along with band, I also dedicate a little too much of my life towards my FIRST robotics team, #4628 Suit Bots.</p>
      <p>Some fun facts: I am an indentical twin and aspiring engineer! I really enjoy writing and watching anime too. My friends would describe me as a natural leader and passionate. I am not afraid to take risks and willing to go the extra mile for the betterment of others (especially my friends and classmates!).</p>
      <p>Weather you see me as you drum major, notebooker, "pro-gamer," or friend, I hope to make a positive impact within my community and beyond!!</p>

    <h5>Robotics<h5>
      <p>I have been compeiting in FIRST's FTC Robotics since 7th grade. Starting off in middle school, I was a builder for my team. Moving onto High School, I am now Awards Coordinator and head of our notebook/awards unit for<a href="https://www.instagram.com/suitbots/?hl=en">#4628 Suit Bots</a>. Through teamwork and my dedication towards the team, we have won 2nd Inspire Award (highest award at competitions), 1st Think Award, and multiple Design and Connect awards.</p>
      <p>With this, my team is also very heavy on advocacy. We are very adament about equal treatment for LGBTQ+ and minority communitites within STEM. Becuase of this, my friends and I started our own organization,<a href="https://pocs-of-first.carrd.co/">POCs of FIRST</a> where we collaborate witth teams and FIRST students to promote diversity and inclusivity within STEM. Through my organization, I manage our partner teams, make posts for our Instagram, as well as design promotional material to pass around. I also train staff members and manage the POCs of FIRST email.</p>

      <p>Being in band is a big part of my self-identity. Starting off with piano in elementary school to now playing flute and conducting, music has always been apart of me.</p>
      <p>For piano, I have taken the Certificate of Merit exams, reaching all the way to level 10 (Advanced). I have recieved multiple Branch Honor medals for my piano playing abilities.</p>
      <p>In MHS' marching band, I play the flute and conduct as drum major in my junior and senior year. In MHS' drumline, I play the synth.</p>

        <h5>MASA Junior Project</h5>
        <p>MASA, or the Math and Science Academy at MHS is an academy dedicated to brighten students' STEM education. This academy allows priority for math and science APs, increase knowledge of STEM world through keynote speaker presentations, and allow for students to collaborate and connect with peers and experts to learn and teach more about STEM.</p>
        <p>Every junior in the Math and Science Academy is tasked to do a Junior Project, competing for awards in this year long project. For mine, I worked with my sister, Kaylena, to build a dog wheelchair. This wheelchair was made out of PVC pipes, glue, and straps. Our goal was to build a dog wheelchair and have it work by the presentation date. We built and documented our build process in an engineering notebook. Utlizing the JPL Design Process and documentation skills, we created a working wheelchair by the end.</p>
